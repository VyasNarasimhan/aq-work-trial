You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task instruction and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

For each response:
1. Analyze the current state based on any terminal output provided
2. Determine the next set of commands needed to make progress
3. Decide if you need to see the output of these commands before proceeding

Instruction:
Solve the Huarong Dao sliding block puzzle.

Initial board configuration (5 rows x 4 columns):
ACCB
ACCB
DGGE
DSSE
S..S

Pieces:
- C: Cao Cao (2x2 block) - the main piece you need to move
- A,B,D,E: Vertical generals (each occupies 2x1)
- G: Horizontal general (occupies 1x2)
- S: Four soldiers (each occupies 1x1)
- .: Empty spaces

Movement Rules:
- A piece can slide into adjacent empty space(s) in four directions (up/down/left/right)
- A piece must have enough empty spaces to accommodate its size
- All parts of a piece move together as one unit
- Pieces cannot overlap, rotate, or move outside the board
- Only one piece can be moved at a time

Goal:
- Move Cao Cao (C) to the bottom center position
- Victory condition: C occupies rows 4-5, columns 2-3
- This represents Cao Cao "escaping" through the exit

Output your solution to /app/solution.json with the following format:
{
  "boards": [
    ["ACCB", "ACCB", "DGGE", "DSSE", "S..S"],
    ... (intermediate states)
    [...final state with C at bottom center...]
  ]
}

Your response must be a JSON object that matches this schema:

Don't include markdown formatting.

Note that you operate directly on the terminal from inside a tmux session. Use tmux keystrokes like `C-x` or `Escape` to interactively navigate the terminal. If you would like to execute a command that you have written you will need to append a newline character to the end of your command.

For example, if you write "ls -la" you will need to append a newline character to the end of your command like this: `ls -la\n`.

One thing to be very careful about is handling interactive sessions like less, vim, or git diff. In these cases, you should not wait for the output of the command. Instead, you should send the keystrokes to the terminal as if you were typing them.

The current terminal state is:
root@a52df356a691:/app#
